An unofficial client for the Vestaboard API in go.

# Usage

## Create a new client

```
client := vestaboard.New(c.APIKey, c.Secret)
```

From there, use the client methods

* `Viewer` to get the information from the connected viewer
* `Subscriptions` to get the subscription information
* `SendText` to post a message with the default formatting

# Examples

There are a nice set of demos in cmd/
To use these, set your API Key and Secret as environment variables.
```
export APIKEY=YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE
export SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_GOES_HERE
```

Then just run the 'main.go' in whichever directory:
```
go run cmd/send-text/main.go
```

## Send Text

Does what it says - writes 'Hello World' to your vestaboard.

## Clock

Writes out the current time about every 15 seconds.

## Game of Life

Conway's game of life.

## Subscriptions

Prints out the current subscriptions tied to the Vestaboard to the command-line.
